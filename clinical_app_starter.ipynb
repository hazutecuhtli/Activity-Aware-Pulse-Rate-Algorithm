    "\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Women Vs Men heart rates\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Data behaviour\n",
    "\n",
    "Physiological resting heart rates are in the range from 60 to 100 beats per minute. One possible explanation for the data behaviour is those female users younger than 65 years old were selected from a specific group of people, such as athletes. Therefore, there is a bias towards those resting heart rates, which increase the difference between older people who probably are not as active as them. For male users, there can be observed a more balanced selected of users.\n",
    "\n",
    "A different reason can be how much movements users have with respect to their ages, maybe female users older than 60 years generate movements that are translated into artefacts that increased their estimated heart rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What else can we do or go and find to figure out what is really happening? How would that improve the results?\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do is to see if the age groups are balanced, then to see if the same amount of people is used to represent each of the groups of interest and to see how those are compared when considering different genders. Additionally, it can be analyzed the average movements for female users that belong to a different group of ages, to see if some important highlights can be found."
